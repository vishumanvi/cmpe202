Installed FeatureIDE and AspectJ Eclipse plugins and used the source code provided to run Gumball machine configurations in Aspect J. Attaching the 3 screenshots that I ran.

In Lab#1, I had to create 3 seperate Gumball classes for each of the 3 variations and implement the difference. With AspectJ, we don't have to implement different implementations of Gumball machines and drive requirements through configurations. Therefore, it's very easy to design for change.
