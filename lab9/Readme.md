Have used the original code example of Strategy pattern from class that uses different sorting algorithms and refactored it to use lambdas. The original version is familiar but has to implement multiple classes and lot of code. Using lamdas, there's no need to have so many classes and I have used anonmyous functions for sorting algorithm implementations.
